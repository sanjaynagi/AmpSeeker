The default name is `metadata.tsv`. The file only requires one column, sample_id, and a column with which to group the data for downstream analyses (for example, by location). Any extra metadata columns can be included (e.g location, taxon, strain, country, year etc) and used to split data and colour the results figures, with configurable options in the `config.yaml` file (cohort-columns).\n",

If converting BCL files to fastq within the workflow, a `SampleSheet.csv` must be placed in the Illumina run folder. The SampleSheet must have the CreateFastqForIndexReads parameter set to 1, please see the `exampleSampleSheet.csv` in the `resources/` directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### SampleSheet.csv Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "The SampleSheet.csv is a structured file with several sections:\n",
    "- **[Header]**: Contains experiment metadata\n",
    "- **[Reads]**: Defines read lengths (typically 151 for paired-end reads)\n",
    "- **[Settings]**: Contains critical parameters including `CreateFastqForIndexReads=1`\n",
    "- **[Data]**: Sample information including IDs, indexes, and metadata\n",
    "\n",
    "The `CreateFastqForIndexReads=1` setting in the [Settings] section is essential as it instructs the BCL conversion to generate FASTQ files for index reads, which are used for demultiplexing samples.\n",

    "\n",
    "Required columns for the [Data] section:\n",
    "- **sample_ID**: Unique sample identifier, used to name output files\n",
    "- **sample_name**: Name displayed in reports (often the same as sample_ID)\n",
    "- **index**: Forward index sequence for demultiplexing\n",
    "- **index2**: Reverse index sequence for demultiplexing (for dual indexing)\n",
    "\n",
    "Optional metadata columns can be added (e.g., well, plate_name, taxon, location, country, latitude, longitude) and will be incorporated into analysis results.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### FASTQ File Specifications for Illumina\n",
    "\n",
    "If providing fastq files, two gzipped fastq files for each sample are required, one for each pair of paired-end reads. Reads can be already trimmed or AmpSeeker can trim them, using the fastp module (configurable in the config.yaml).\n",
    "\n",
    "Two options are available for specifying the location of the fastq files. Either the metadata contains two columns `fq1` and `fq2` with the paths to the fastq files, or the fastq files are placed in the following directory (`resources/reads/`) with the following naming pattern:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` \n",

    "\n",
    "Reads should be named as `{sample_id}_1.fastq.gz`, `{sample_id}_2.fastq.gz`.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If providing fastq paths in the metadata file, they can be named anything. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Nanopore Data\n",
    "#### FASTQ File Specifications for Nanopore\n",
    "\n",
    "For Nanopore data, provide single gzipped fastq files for each sample. The metadata file should contain a single column `fq1` with paths to the fastq files, or place files in `resources/reads/` with the naming pattern `{sample_id}.fastq.gz`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Nanopore metadata.tsv format:**\n",

    "**Reference genome files**\n",
    "\n",
    "For both platforms, genome alignment requires a fasta file containing the genome sequence. All input `.fa` files can be gzipped `.fa.gz`.   \n",
    "\n",
    "Reference genomes can be downloaded from vectorbase with the `resources/reference/download-vectorbase-reference.sh` script. Run it from the root AmpSeeker directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "The user provides the path to the reference files in the configuration file (`config.yaml`).\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Genome chromosomes reference file (.fa/.fa.gz)**. Contains the DNA sequence for the genome in fasta format.\n",
    "2. **Genome feature file (.gff3 format)**. \n",

    "Ensure that contigs in the reference genome match the contigs in the bed file. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Note - Genome reference files from VectorBase now have prefixes before each contig name, such as 'AgamP4_2L'. Either the bed file can be updated to match these, or the names in the reference files can be modified. The downloader script can strip these prefixes automatically."
